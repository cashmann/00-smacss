##### How did you determine which rules should be placed in each new CSS file?

(Put your answer here)
I did so based on the scale and effect each rule had on the page. The largest, most generalized rules belonged in the base.css, the more specific rules that positioned the main elements on the page and dictated their size belonged in the layout.css, and the rules that changed things such as content within elements and colors belonged in the modules.css
